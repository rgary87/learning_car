This is a test project for a genetic-algorithm fed neural-network designed to teach a "car" to navigate a path.
The result shown in these screenshots are achieved after about 350 generation of 500 cars. The best car here does one and a half loop. The neural-network weights are stored in [a json file](https://github.com/rgary87/learning_car/blob/master/src/main/resources/best_car.json) and parsed at each start of the program
